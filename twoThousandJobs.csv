Customs plays a vital role in preventing the illegal movement of people and harmful goods across Australias border.  In 
performing our role, we work closely with a range of agencies.  Together we are called on to provide a sense of security to the 
community, supporting the continuation of the Australian lifestyle.
The Compliance Division ensures the accurate and timely reporting of cargo and the correct payment of Government revenue, 
as required by Customs legislation.  This work involves close engagement with industry and other stakeholders. Compliance 
Officers work under the supervision of a Senior Compliance Officer.  They undertake a range of activities that improve 
compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to import and export cargo.  These activities include: Monitoring the 
movement of cargo through the import or export process; Intervening in the movement of import or export cargo, in order to 
check the accuracy of reports and declaration made to Customs; Reviewing previous import or export transactions, by auditing 
clients documents; and Promoting compliance through education and other assistance to industry. Compliance Officers must: 
Communicate well, both orally and in writing; Have a good eye for numbers and detail; Be able to concentrate; Enjoy working in 
a happy and supportive team environment; Be self-motivated and committed to their work; and Develop an excellent 
understanding of both the cargo industry and relevant Customs legislation. 
Experience in the cargo industry or Customs work would be an advantage, but Customs provides substantial training and 
development opportunities. Compliance work is not the most high profile or dramatic type of work within Customs, but it can be 
very satisfying, as it makes a significant contribution to community protection and can uncover major revenue frauds.   It can 
also lead to other roles in Customs, such as intelligence or investigations.
